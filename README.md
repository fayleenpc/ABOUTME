## Professional Summary

Backend-focused Software Engineer with strong experience in designing scalable, production-grade systems and integrating AI-driven components into real-world applications.

I specialize in backend architecture, secure service orchestration, event-driven systems, and AI automation platforms. My engineering approach emphasizes reproducibility, system determinism, structured logging, and secure infrastructure management.

Beyond traditional backend development, I have engineered cross-platform AI-powered products integrating computer vision (YOLO-based detection), OCR pipelines, structured dataset workflows, and deterministic replay architectures.

I build systems — not scripts.
